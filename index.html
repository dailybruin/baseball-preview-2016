        <h2>Portion 1 Title Goes Here</h2>

        <p>A massive, 80-foot sign advertising the latest Hollywood attraction looms over drivers heading west on Wilshire Boulevard through Westwood.</p>

        <p>Towering above the entertainment mecca of Los Angeles, the colorful images cut a striking figure against the cold steel and concrete of the surrounding high-rises.</p>

        <p>In January, pedestrians were treated to an image plugging the much-awaited sequel to 2014’s instant classic, “Ride Along.”</p>

        <p>But under the outstretched right leg of Kevin Hart – midway through a flying karate kick – read a small peculiar one-sentence label.</p>

        <p>“Sky Posters: Creating and selling commercial pop culture posters, available inside.”</p>

        <p>The longer story behind that phrase is a muddled deep dive into the Los Angeles municipal system that has shaped the history of an otherwise nondescript West Los Angeles office building.</p>

        <p>So what’s in a wall? Well, it turns out it’s a complicated tale involving the timeless political themes of money, greed and, of course, a legal loophole or two.</p>

        <p>The Westwood Medical Plaza building started out simply enough. It was built in the early 1960s as one of noted local architect Paul Williams’ last commissions, according to the Los Angeles Conservancy. The building’s west wall was left intentionally windowless so that patients weren’t forced to look out into the Los Angeles National Cemetery while sitting at the examination table.</p>

        <p>But decades after the 12-story building’s construction, the white wall standing stark against the major urban vein of the Wilshire Corridor evolved into a valuable business opportunity for the building owners.</p>

        <p>The Muller Company, which purchased the building in 1995, pictured the wall as a blank canvas for lucrative advertisements – and decided to act on it.</p>

        <p>After striking a deal with Walt Disney Studios, the new owners commissioned commercial artist Mike McNeilly and his company, SkyTag, Inc., to create a mural for the upcoming re-release of “The Little Mermaid” in 1997.</p>

        <p>However, LA Councilman Mike Feuer blocked McNeilly’s efforts to gain legal permission for the advertisement, and the painting was halted early into the process.</p>

        <p>Frustrated by the bureaucratic system as well as Feuer’s unflinching stance against what he considered billboard blight, McNeilly gave up on the legal route and turned to guerilla-style efforts in order to get his next project up, which would eventually land him into deeper trouble with the city.</p>

        <p>Playing the role of “The Man,” city officials arrested McNeilly two years after “The Little Mermaid” fiasco while he was painting a giant mural of the Statue of Liberty on the wall. At the time, he called it a tribute in honor of the veterans interred in the nearby cemetery.</p>

        <p>On his way down the building, the artist was surreptitiously able to paint a tear rolling down Lady Liberty’s face, a cheeky commentary on what he said was an infringement on his constitutional right to free expression.</p>

        <p>Less subtly, McNeilly returned to the scene after his arrest and pasted a colossal “censored” banner across the unfinished work.</p>

        <p>For his part, McNeilly has always maintained that he is purely an artist, exercising his First Amendment right to freedom of expression by dotting the landscape of West Los Angeles with all-American consumerist images through his company.</p>

        <p>“Look at my history,” McNeilly wrote in the June 2000 issue of the New Times L.A. “I’ve done this for years. For charities. For free. For political statements. And I’ve never charged anybody. But people don’t like to think, ‘You mean, there’s actually some crazy artist who actually does stuff for free?’”</p>

      <div class="large-8 large-centered columns">
        <h2>Portion 2 Title Goes Here</h2>

        <p>Westwood Community Council Chair Steve Sann sees McNeilly’s efforts a bit differently.</p>

        <p>“He’s not an artist – he’s a billboard businessman,” Sann said. “He’s a horrific perpetrator of supergraphics in the world and advertises billboards so large you can see them from space.”</p>

        <p>Sticking to his guns, McNeilly fought back against the charges, asserting his right to free expression of a noncommercial image. He later emerged victorious when a state appeals court sided with him and allowed the Statue of Liberty image to remain in place.</p>

        <p>At face level, this may sound like the story of an innocent citizen standing up to an oppressive governmental force.</p>

        <p>A letter sent to the Los Angeles Times a few months before McNeilly’s court victory, however, ended up being oddly prescient.</p>

        <p>“Who could complain about something as patriotic as the Lady? Should his claim be upheld, though, I can pretty much guarantee that his next mural won’t be of his mom holding an apple pie. It’ll be right back to the lucrative beer, jeans, cars, etc. I do hope the courts won’t be taken in by this man’s patently money-grubbing ploy,” wrote South Pasadena resident Mike Kvammen in response to a story about the mural in the paper.</p>

        <p>Kvammen turned out to be slightly wrong in his prediction. Instead of beer, jeans or cars, it was Japanese bombers screaming out at drivers on Wilshire Boulevard.</p>

        <p>Not long after the court upheld McNeilly’s right to the memorial sign, he changed it again, this time as an advertisement for the Ben Affleck flick, “Pearl Harbor.”</p>

        <p>Again, city officials ordered it be removed and threatened to hit McNeilly with fines or jail time if he refused.</p>

        <p>McNeilly and the building owners ended up capitulating, but a few months later, the events of 9/11 shocked the nation, and the wall in Westwood again became a symbolic battleground over liberty, law and public art. Following the attacks, McNeilly painted another mural on the wall featuring Lady Liberty and a firefighter in honor of the first responders.</p>

        <p>“This mural is a tribute to the courage and sacrifice of all the people who come and put their lives on the line in times of need,” McNeilly told the Los Angeles Times in 2001.</p>

        <p>The new artwork had city officials in a political bind, forcing them to commend the work’s patriotic and artistic merit, while having to reiterate its illegality. Eventually the piece was found in violation of city ordinance, and McNeilly was hit with more than two dozen code violations, each carrying up to $1,000 in fines, and six months in jail.</p>

        <p>Backed by the American Civil Liberties Union, McNeilly again initiated a First Amendment fight against the city and its charges for the second time in as many years.</p>

        <h2>Portion 3 Title Goes Here</h2>

        <p>“There is no justification for such infringements on private, noncommercial speech,” said Dan Tokaji, a staff attorney with the ACLU of Southern California, in a statement at the time.</p>

        <p>City officials contended that McNeilly was trying to make his mark, except in a less artistic way – by opening up the Wilshire Corridor to profitable billboard advertising.</p>

        <p>The billboard industry is a force in LA politics to this very day, lobbying City Council for favorable regulation in the geographic center of the multibillion-dollar business. The efforts can be seen not too far away from UCLA, alongside the seedy glitz and glamour of the Sunset Strip.</p>

        <p>The industry’s influence was also evident in the 2001 race for city attorney, which had major consequences for the controversial wall in Westwood.</p>

        <p>On one side of the race was Feuer, who consistently stymied McNeilly and his efforts to get his work on the wall. Feuer was an attorney and politician who was known to rankle colleagues and special interest groups while acting as an outspoken advocate for West LA community members.</p>

        <p>On the other side was Rockard “Rocky” Delgadillo, a native of East Los Angeles and a football star at Harvard University. After returning to Los Angeles, he worked as an attorney at prominent law firms before being appointed as then-Mayor Richard Riordan’s deputy mayor for economic development.</p>

        <p>Going into the race, Feuer had the advantage of greater name recognition, but Delgadillo had a secret weapon up his sleeve, spurred on by a recent court decision that approved so-called “independent expenditures” in the race.</p>

        <p>This allowed businesses and special interest groups to contribute independently to campaigns if they followed a series of regulations, including not coordinating with the politicians beforehand.</p>

        <p>“I think it was one of the first campaigns where we started to see a high level of independent expenditures by companies,” said Jean Merl, a former Los Angeles Times reporter who covered the election.</p>

        <p>In his time on the city council, Feuer had made enemies of the billboard industry, consistently introducing new legislation to tamp down on what he considered to be blight on the Angeleno landscape.</p>

        <p>The major companies in the billboard industry decided to voice their displeasure toward Feuer to the tune of more than $400,000, an amount virtually unheard of at the time in a municipal election in the city. This staggering contribution came in the form of dozens of signs and billboards advertising Delgadillo across Los Angeles.</p>

        <p>“Clearly, the billboard companies didn’t like Mike Feuer,” Merl said. “He would be the last person they’d want as city attorney.”</p>

        <p>Sann put it a little more bluntly, accusing Delgadillo of being “owned and bought” by the billboard industry.</p>

        <p>Billboard companies blanketed the city with Delgadillo’s name and image, making the generally quiet race for city attorney into a massive public affair. Delgadillo emerged as the victor of the hard-fought runoff election with 52.4 percent of the vote.</p>

        <p>Soon after Delgadillo took office, City Council passed a ban on new “off-site” billboards, which are signs that direct to businesses at other locations. This kicked off a wave of lawsuits and litigation from sign companies wanting to assert their right to make money off billboard space.</p>

        <p>In his new role as city attorney, Delgadillo was able to craft legal agreements that proved profitable to the sign companies that supported him during his campaign.</p>

        <p>While the biggest media attention was focused on a 2006 settlement with Clear Channel to convert 400 of its billboards to more valuable digital billboards, a local example was on the humble west wall of the Westwood Medical Plaza building.</p>

        <p>One of these allegedly favorable settlements in 2003 ended a series of back-and-forth lawsuits between McNeilly, the building owners and the city over the right to advertise on the wall.</p>

        <p>“(Delgadillo) decided to sell Westwood down the river instead of aggressively fighting billboard blight,” Sann said.</p>

        <p>As part of the settlement, the building owners agreed to put a public service message for one month out of the year on the wall or pay the city the equivalent revenue. Industry professionals estimate the cost of the posters at up to $3,000 a day in the busy throughway.</p>

        <p>Additionally, the settlement gave the building owners the right to use the wall as a place for advertisements as long as it was solely used to promote “on-site” businesses.</p>

        <p>That gets us to the origin story of the little phrase.</p>

        <p>Under the terms of the settlement, only current tenants of the building with “bona fide office space” conducting “bona fide business” are allowed to place messages on the wall.</p>

        <p>This meant that while McNeilly and the building owners were given the right to put up new signs, they were also left with a problem. The Westwood Medical Plaza building is home to doctors’ offices, health stores, pharmacies and even an LA Fitness, but it doesn’t house a movie production studio or theater, which would be the legal way for the profitable movie advertisements to qualify as an on-site sign.</p>

        <p>So, McNeilly and the building owners decided to try something else. They set up a company in the building called Sky Posters, in effect creating an on-site business to legally justify the advertisements on the wall.</p>
      </div>

        <h2>Portion 4 Title Goes Here</h2>

        <p>The building’s fifth floor houses the company’s sparse office space, which sells a limited amount of posters at exorbitant prices. A normal 27-by-40 inch poster, which retails for less than $20 on Amazon, instead sells for $110 there.</p>

        <p>When asked for comment, an employee of the company refused to stay and answer questions about the business, instead choosing to leave the building via the parking lot. The employee said that the business hours were from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays, alluding to a settlement provision that required bona fide businesses to be open during normal business hours. Multiple trips to the office, however, have seen the office door locked in the afternoon with no response to knocking.</p>

        <p>The Sky Posters website features little additional information, as well as a history section pretty much cribbed word for word from the Wikipedia page for “poster.”</p>

        <p>Dennis Hathaway, the president of the Coalition to Ban Billboard Blight, said he’s been up to the location multiple times over the years and does not believe in the authenticity of the business.</p>

        <p>“In my view, it’s just a sham,” Hathaway said. “Quite frankly, he’s thumbing his nose at the city.”</p>

        <p>After his success in Westwood, McNeilly widened his scope aAfter his success in Westwood, McNeilly widened his scope across the city, posting supergraphic advertisements in more than a dozen sites across Los Angeles and picking up the profits.</p>

        <p>Carmen Trutanich, who succeeded Delgadillo as city attorney, took McNeilly and building management companies to court over the additional advertisements, which the city claimed were illegal.</p>

        <p>In a case of legal déjà vu, McNeilly tried to make a civil liberties case out of the matter, again posting giant pictures of the Statue of Liberty at the locations. The trouble was that several of those sites displayed images with commercial advertisements for movies, TV shows, automobiles and other products and services not too soon after.</p>

        <p>Hit with the preponderance of evidence, SkyTag, Inc., decided to settle with the city in 2013 by paying $1.2 million and removing the illegal images from 17 locations, including one on the opposite eastern wall of the Westwood Medical Plaza building.</p>

        <p>However, under the terms of the new settlement, the previous agreement with Delgadillo still stood, meaning that the west wall was left untouched by the legal decision. Since the case was settled “with prejudice,” the city is unable to bring the case back to court under the same charges, leaving the issue languishing in a kind of legal </p>

        <p>“That fine was just a slap on the wrist,” Hathaway said. “He’s an opportunist. He’s making money and he doesn’t care about the law.”</p>

        <p>In the 15 years since the original billboard fight, a lot has changed. Delgadillo was booted out of politics on the back of a number of controversies during his tenure as city attorney. Feuer, on the other hand, redeemed his 2001 defeat and entered the city attorney’s office in 2013, where he has been vocal about removing billboard blight.</p>

        <p>And chastened by his defeat, the formerly chatty McNeilly has mainly strayed away from the public eye, holed up in his Beverly Hills compound, which Zillow estimates to be worth more than $2.5 million. McNeilly refused to comment for this story after repeated requests.</p>

        <p>Finally, during the several weeks between this story’s conception and its publication, the little Sky Posters label has disappeared underneath a fresh layer of white paint, erasing the trail of our origin story.</p>

        <p>What has stayed constant throughout the years though are the colossal images overlooking the bumper-to-bumper traffic on Wilshire Boulevard, a literal illustration of the curvy and complicated story of a lone wall in Westwood.</p>
